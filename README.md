## about
seraph originated as a simple passion project; one that was simply meant to host a couple fun games to play on. what started as a prototype with four games has bloomed into something else entirely.

there's always been a problem with me with unblocked games websites, but more specifically the user interfaces. often these interfaces are loaded up with useless information, are extremely difficult to navigate or load ads every five seconds. seraph attempts to allievate this problem by having a completely simplified and minimalistic user interface, designed with the user in mind.

in addition to this, seraph supports and encourages full hosting support. with the tutorial provided, you can instantly set up a seraph webpage using github pages in under 2 minutes, without any cost or prior knowledge of coding.

i hope you find some use out of this project :)
